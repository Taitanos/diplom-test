        review: ["The apartment looks great (he did the wood work himself), it has air conditioning, and is very clean. There‘s a beach really close to the apartment and the apartment is also a great base to get to other beaches with the car for example Fontane Bianche or Taormina. There‘s also restaurants close by which are quite cheap and you can also have a drink just a few minutes away where the castle is. We used the private parking, which was also great, because we did not have to look for a parking spot on the street. And there’s a little super market right next to the apartment.", "Incredibly friendly and caring host!Excellent location near the heart of the city.", "Spacious and clean apartment with good location.Host was very helpful throughout our stay and even provided us a ride to the airport.Would recommend to anyone."],

        description: "Exclusive apartments located on one of the main historical attractions of Catania, the Bellini Opera House. This luxurious house faces directly onto Piazza Vincenzo Bellini, and 3 of its 4 balconies open directly onto one of Catania's top attractions, the Bellini Opera House! The apartment is located in a prestigious 18th century building and includes a living and dining room, kitchen, 1 bedroom, bathroom and 4 open balconies.",
        review: ["The balcony and location can’t be beat.", "This apartment is amazing! Nicely renovated, high ceilings, historical building, great view from the front balconies. The only thing that you have to be aware of - the square is loud with party noise at night (live music etc. won’t stop until 1 am even during weekdays.. at least when we were there). Other than that, it’s just astonishing.", " This is a beautiful apartment in the Opera house, Plaza. The balconies overlooking the Opera house on this and the apartment its self-spacious spotlessly clean and a delight, it was a pleasure to stay over, hopefully I will go back again.", "It is a nice flat with stylished flat design at the center of Catania. The Piazza Vincenzo Bellini is a bit noisy in the evening and at night but it’s nice to watch it from the balcony. We would stay there again."],

        review: ["We have a fantastic stay at Stefy’s place. The Apartment is clean, stylish, cozy and includes everything you need. The location is perfect! 10 minutes to the city center. Just 2 minutes to Catania Centrale and Bus Station. The owner of the Apartment is Stefy. She is the best one! Stefy helps us with everything. She is very kind and communicative. We definitely will come there again.", "It’s very hard to write when you have a lot of emotions! But I will try) the first thing is awesome house. Design is very impressive, everything is clear and conveniently! My friend and I arrived at different time and this wasn’t a problem for our mistress. Stefania was too kind to us, she told everything about Catania and places to go, she made for us the most delicious breakfast for whole our life!!! I recommend Stefania everyone who wants staying in Catania!", "The stay at the apartment was really great. It is located close to the city center and it we felt very comfortable. Especially the way Stefy was caring for us, making sure we feel good, was extraordinary. Thank you for being so kind to us!", "We enjoyed our stay in Stefy‘s apartment so much.
